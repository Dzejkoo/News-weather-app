# News - weather app ✌️

-> Live: https://dzejkoo.github.io/News-weather-app/ (NewsApi in developer plan is no more working in production. If you want test this feature clone this repo to your desctop)

Simple app that allows you to check weather and news from the world. Here I try to learn how to work with fetch API and use OOP JS. My own layout design.

## Technologies:

- [Javascirpt](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

## Built with:

- [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/) - Free worldwide news API
- [WeatherForecastAPI](https://www.weatherbit.io/) - Free forecast weather API
- [DailyWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/) - Free daily weather API

## Setup:

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Run the app by `npm start`.
